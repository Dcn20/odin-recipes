                <li>1 1/3 Cups water, plus more as needed</li>

                <li> Syrup for dipping (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine pancake mix and water in a medium bowl
                     and stir until just blended (there may be a few lumps)
                </li>
                <li>Heat half of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over
                     medium heat until melted
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dip half of the bacon in the batter until evenly coated
                     and place in the skillet.  
                     Cook undisturbed until lightly browned and slightly puffed, 
                     about 2-3 minutes.  Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes or 
                     until the pancake is cooked through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat with remaining bacon and batter. 
                    Serve with syrup if desired for dipping.
